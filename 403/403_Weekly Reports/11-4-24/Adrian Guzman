Project Status Report: 11/17/24 (Writing on 11/17, but for 11/4 week)
Sub-System: MCU/Processing

I began to solder my board this week, and finished it by friday. After this I tested the voltage and ensured all the pins were getting the required signals. The board turned on after input and 
held a steady 3.3v after the current on power supply was set to 500mA. Originally, I had set the supply to 61mA and did not have enough power to the board. Furthermore, the LED's for 3.3v turned on
and the LED for GPIO pins turned on when I probed them. This confirms that traces are connected properly. The next step is to get the XDS110 debugger to connect so I can program my board.
