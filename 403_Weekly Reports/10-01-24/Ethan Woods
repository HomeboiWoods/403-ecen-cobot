Project Status Report: 10/1/24
Sub-System: Motor Driver and Motor Control Subsystem

Howdy,

This week I was not able to accomplish much. I had a very busy schedule including a test, 2 programming
assignments, 2 weekly homeworks, and the finshing of Documents for 403. After working on Documents up until 
Thursday (when they were Due), I went to work Friday then drove home. After being home all weekend, I got back into town
on Monday 9/30, then went into work. So on the day of 10/1, I do not have any progress to show for this week.
Now that this week is my first clear week since the start of school, I plan to finally spent REAL time on the Subsystem Introduction
Project and finishing my calculations for torque. I have found some friends who are Mechanical Engineers that I will try to confirm my 
calculations with once done. By next Tuesday, I will have my Subsystem Intro Project done and ready for demo, as well as motor calculations
so motors can begin to be ordered. With our Texas Instruments EVMs coming in soon, I need to be ready to work with them.

Thank you,
Ethan Woods
