Project Status Report: 9/24/24
Sub-System: Motor Driver and Motor Control subsystem

Howdy,

This week, I worked on researching for the different types of motors I needed. After talking with our sponsor, I got a better idea of how big this project really is.
I have confirmed that our motors will fall within the operating range of 24-48V with a payload of 1-2 lbs. As this is the case, I have also realized we will need much more powerful motors than I initally realized.
While I am still in the process of selecting motors, I realized I need to do Free Body Diagrams to represent our Cobot under max strain/load to select a correct torque range of BLDC Encoder Motors.
My plan is to continue research on the motors and have the Free Body Diagram calculations done by next week to have a better idea of the torque range we need.
I also plan to start the Introduction Project this week, as I didn't realize the importance of it these past weeks.

Best,
Ethan Woods
