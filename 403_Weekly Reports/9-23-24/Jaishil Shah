Project Status Report: 9/23/24
Sub-System: Mobile Application/Bluetooth Interface

This week, I have changed a large portion of my subsystem. I have scrapped Swift and switched over to FlutterFlow for app development. 
The program is simpler and easier to understand, taking me about 4-5 hours to figure out how to use it. I spent the weekend developing the 
subsystem introduction project, and have completed the app. The only remaining step is sending the application to the app store, which I am currently
figuring out with the Apple Development Account. Regarding group-level progress, we are currently working on the FSR and ICD, and have already completed 
the Validation and Execution Plan. For the latter half of this week, I plan to start working on the application that we will use for the full project,
which I have already gotten a head start on. The goal is to finish the mobile app in 2-3 weeks. Once that is completed, I will work with the ESP-32, PCB
design, and Bluetooth connectivity.
