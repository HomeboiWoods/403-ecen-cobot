Project Status Report: September 23th 2024
Sub-System: MCU/Connectivity

I have completed my sub system project to 90%, will wrap it up this week following heavy discussion with Lusher on multiple different questions I had regarding altium.
I spend 10-15hrs this week on Altium. Understanding how everything works, messing with settings, creating footprint, PCB layouts, and creating the physical PCB.
As a team we finished the introduction presentation and presented in on Monday. This presenation detailed what our project was as well as who is in charge of what.
The remainder of the time, we have been working on the FSR, ICD, validation, and execution plan.
