Last week, I completed and ordered my new revised board and the components. I also worked with Jaishil to build the robotic arm from Amazon.
This coming week, I will be working on the physical design. We need to design a way to mount out BLDC motor to the arm, and we need to work on board storage and placement. We will also
work on programming the robot from Amazon and its servo motors.
If my boards come back, I will solder and test them.
