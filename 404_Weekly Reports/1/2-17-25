Last week, I completed soldering my board and completed validating up to 25V input. I also worked on the physical design with Jaishil.
We were able to cut out a board of wood and a board of acrylic that are 11" by 14". 
This week, I plan to complete validation up to the full 48V and ensure I have a DC voltage with no noise to begin integration, and to continue work on the physical design.
