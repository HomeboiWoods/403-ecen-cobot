Last week, I started soldering my board. I completed about 75% of it, and am planning to finish the rest during lab this morning.
I also helped finalize a physical design. We plan to come in later this week to fabricate the physical design.
After soldering my board, I plan to test it this week and possibly begin intgeration.
