Sub-System: Mobile Application/Bluetooth Interface

This week, I am working on setting up a MacOS Virtual Machine to run Swift (XCode) and being able to confirm the functionality of the program. 
Additionally, I looked at the subsystem project and determined that the mobile app is the most suitable for the subsystem I am implementing this semester.
I started the Coursera course for learning Swift, and hope to start coding and working on early implementation this week. 
Regarding group-level progress, we have completed the ConOps and are currently working on the Mid-Term Presentation, FSR, ICD, Execution, and Validation Plan.
I plan to complete the Coursera course by early October and have the early stages of the mobile application completed. 
I also want to start looking into Bluetooth connectivity and am planning on tinkering with the ESP-32 once the mobile application is completed.
