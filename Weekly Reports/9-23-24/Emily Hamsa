Project Status Report: 9/23/24
Sub-System: Power and Battery Management

Last week, we focused on the midterm presentation. We wrote the slides and added important information, and split up how we planned to share the presentation.
We also completed our validation report and execution plan, which was a part of the deliverables for the presentation. This included planning out the rest of our semester.
This week, we will be working to complete the FSR, ICD, and revising the ConOps for the deliverable due this Thursday. A bulk of our time this week will be spent working on these 
documents.

Individually, I continued to work on the load list. I got my questions answered and am planning to use Webench to assist my selection of parts. To finalize my load list and
begin PCB design, I am waiting until motors are selected, but I will be able to estimate the load of these and draft a design. This week, I also plan to complete the subsystem
introduction project so that I am able to quickly begin the PCB design.
