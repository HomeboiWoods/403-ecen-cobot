Last week, our group spent the most time on the FSR, ICD, Validation and Execution, and revising the ConOps for the midterm report deliverable. To complete these documents, we revised and finalized a lot of aspects of our design.
Individually, I completed the subsystem introduction project. I did find that I had some trouble learning how to use Altium; there was a learning curve with how to both use Altium and design a PCB. I feel like I walked away from the project with more knowledge and confidence in designing PCB's, and am in a good place to begin designing my PCB's for my subsystem.
This week, I plan to finalize the battery size and begin working on my power management system PCB.
