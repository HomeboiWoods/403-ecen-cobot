Project Status Report: 10/7/24
Sub-System: MCU/Processing


After communicating with Dr. Lusher I have re-mapped what I need to accomplish for my specific subsystem. Being that my sponsor wants 15x motor drivers for 5x BLDC motors, Dr. Lusher suggested I prove the concept for only 1 motor. This requires that I configure 3x motor drivers
in my Altium schematirc as it would be pointless to repeate the work for 15x motor drivers only for it to not work.

Goal for Altium Schemaatic:

1) Connect 3x motor drivers to MCU (Completed)
      Three motor drivers connected with the GPIO pins of the MCU. Totals 6PWM signals 2x per motor driver, 1 for High 1 for Low.
2) Connect ESP-32 with motor MCU 
3) Micro-USB connection using UART
