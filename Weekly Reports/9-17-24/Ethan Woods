Project Status Report: 9/17/24
Sub-System: Motor Driver and Motor Control subsystem

Howdy,

This week, I worked on the CONOPs Report and did research into what motors we will be using.
I found that our operating range of motors will fall between 24V and 48V, leaning torwards 48V.
The motor we choose will be one of three BLDC varieties (Standard, Frameless, or Standard).
I am now in the process of narrowing down our operating range and selecting a motor to work for.
I will be making sure I have the nessessary applications for when I begin to start using my DRVB161 EVM.
My personal plan is to have the motor selected with a complete outline of my subsystem by next Tuesday so I 
can be ready for the beginning presentations.

Best,
Ethan Woods
