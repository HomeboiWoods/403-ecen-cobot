Subsystem: Power and Battery Management

So far this week, I worked on creating a load list for the components in the system and chose a power IC.
I am now trying to create a list of the rest of the components for the power management PCB, and once I know the motor, I will choose a battery. 
My plan is to talk to Dr. Lusher or the TA about some questions I have for choosing the PCB components. I also plan to work with my group to work on the FSR, IDC, Execution and 
Validation plans, and work on the presentation.
