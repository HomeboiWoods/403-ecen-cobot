Project Status Report: (September 16th 2024)
Sub-System: MCU/Connectivity

For my specific sub system I am in charge of the MCU/Connectivity. This entails making a PCB board with the compatibility to other aspects of the project. I have downloaded all needed software (Altium, C2000 Ware, CCS) for PCB design and evaluation of C2000 MCU when we order an EVM. The subsystem introduction project is what I have been heavily working on thus far. I have completed half of the into project (create schematic library, PCB library, and inverting op-amp circuit schematic (input and outputs are work in progress). I plan to finish this subsystem introduction project by the end of the week. As a team we finished the CONOPS and plan to begin working on the FSR, ICD, Execution, Validation Plan, and prepare for next weeks presentation.
